Hinton was one of the first researchers who demonstrated the use of generalized backpropagation algorithm for
training multi-layer neural nets. He is a leading figure in the deep learning community and
is called by some as the "Godfather of Deep Learning".
His dramatic image-recognition milestone in Imagenet challenge 2012 revolutionized the field of computer vision.
